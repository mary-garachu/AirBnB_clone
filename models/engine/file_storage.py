        This will help you understand why we are looping though the content
        and then passing (**value) as kwargs

        Here is a simplified breakdown:
        This method is initially called by the storage instance of FileStorage
        Check __init__.py of models to understand
        This is what reload does:
        Takes the file, opens and reads it
        It performs Json load on the contents of the file
        Then loops though the loaded content
        It imports the BaseModel - so to create instances
        creates instances of the BaseModel using values of the loaded content
        updates the __objects dictionary with the new instances
